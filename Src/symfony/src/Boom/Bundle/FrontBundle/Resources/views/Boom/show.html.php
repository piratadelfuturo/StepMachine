                <p>Take Care is the second studio album by <a href="#">Canadian</a> recording artist Drake, released November 15, 2011, on Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records.[1][2] It is the follow-up to his 2010 debut album Thank Me Later. Production for the album took place during 2010 to 2011 and was handled by Noah "40" Shebib, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Just Blaze, The Weeknd, and Jamie xx, among others. With the album, Drake sought to record a more cohesive recording than his debut album, which he viewed was rushed in its development.</p>
                <p>Expanding on the sonic aesthetic of his debut album, Take Care features an atmospheric sound that is characterized by low-key musical elements and incorporates R B, pop, and electronica styles. Drake's lyrics mostly eschew boastful raps for introspective lyrics that deal with topics such as failed romances, relationship with friends and family, growing wealth and fame, concerns about leading a hollow life, and despondency. The album has been noted by music writers for its minimalist R&amp;B elements, existential subject matter, conflicted lyrics, and Drake's alternately sung and rapped vocals.</p>
